/**
 * Thin browser entry for desktop shell widgets used by packages/app main.

 * Do **not** re-export `@elizaos/ui/browser` here — that star-export pulls the
 * full agent UI graph (CharacterEditor, chat, core browser bundle) into the
 * anonymous `/login` critical path (#18056). The full browser facade remains
 * at `@elizaos/app-core` → `./browser.ts` for plugin hosts that need it.
