 * connection MUST pass it: reaching for the global `dbWrite` pool from inside
 * an open transaction asks for a SECOND connection while the first is still
 * checked out. In the Cloudflare Worker runtime the pool is sized `max: 1`
 * (`db/client.ts` `createPgPool`), so that second checkout can never be
 * satisfied — the request deadlocks against itself and fails at
 * `connectionTimeoutMillis`, every time, with no concurrency involved.
 * Passing the transaction also makes the write part of the caller's atomic
 * unit rather than an independently committed side effect.
