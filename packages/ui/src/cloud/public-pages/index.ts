/**
 * Public-pages domain barrel.
 *
 * The app shell imports {@link registerPublicPages}
 * to mount all token-gated / auth / marketing / payment routes onto the shared
 * cloud-route registry (the `CloudRouterShell` renders whatever the registry
 * returns). Importing the module for its side effect is enough:
 *
 *   import { registerPublicPages } from "@elizaos/ui/cloud/public-pages/register";
 *   registerPublicPages();
 *
 * Boot registration must import `./register` (or this package's register export
 * path), never this barrel, so LoginPage and other pages stay React.lazy chunks
 * (#18056). The page components + the domain's lib helpers remain re-exported
 * here for hosts that want to mount a page directly (e.g. tests).
 *
 * StewardLoginSection is deliberately NOT re-exported: it imports the
 * wagmi/RainbowKit/Solana wallet stack, and a static re-export here would drag
 * that multi-MB graph into every chunk that loads this barrel. LoginPage already
 * code-splits it behind React.lazy with a designed fallback — import it from
 * "./pages/login/steward-login-section" directly if a host ever needs it.
